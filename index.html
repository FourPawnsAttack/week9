            <h1>What is the Great Barrier Reef?</h1>
            <p style="text-align: justify;margin-right: 20px;">The Great Barrier Reef (GBR), located off the coast of Queensland, Australia, is the world's largest coral reef system, stretching over 2,300km. It is home to a diverse ecosystem, including thousands of species of marine life, such as fish & corals. The reef plays a critical role in supporting biodiversity and protecting coastlines from erosion. Additionally, it contributes significantly to Australia's economy through tourism and fishing industries. However, it faces serious threats from climate change, pollution, and coral bleaching, which endanger its long-term survival. Its protection is crucial for maintaining ecological balance and preserving marine habitats.</p>

          <div><h1>Live Coral Cover in the GBR</h1>
            <p style="text-align: justify;margin-right: 20px;">The GBR experienced a significant decline in live coral cover, particularly IN the early 1990s, where many reefs fell within the 0-20% range. Live coral cover, the percentage of the reef surface occupied by living corals, is crucial for maintaining reef health, as it provides habitat, supports biodiversity, and helps protect coastal areas from erosion. The decline was largely driven by factors like rising ocean temperatures, pollution, and storm damage. However, starting in 2016, the reef began showing signs of recovery, with efforts to mitigate environmental stressors leading to gradual increases in coral regrowth and improvements in overall reef health, although challenges remain. AIMS surveys a different number of reefs each year due to logistical and budgetary constraints, adjusting efforts to cover a representative sample across the Great Barrier Reef's environmental gradients​</p>

          <div><h1>Sea Surface Temperatures in the GBR</h1>
            <p style="text-align: justify;margin-right: 20px;">The graph shows an increasing trend in sea surface temperatures (SST) in the Great Barrier Reef, which is a significant concern for coral health. Rising SSTs contribute to more frequent and severe coral bleaching events, as indicated by the black line marking the coral bleaching threshold, where temperatures above this can cause corals to expel symbiotic algae, leading to bleaching. The second graph shows Degree Heating Weeks (DHW), a measure of accumulated thermal stress over time. DHW quantifies how long and how severely water temperatures exceed the bleaching threshold. An increase in DHW, as seen in the graph, corresponds to prolonged periods of elevated temperatures, which can cause widespread coral mortality. This rise in thermal stress underscores the importance of addressing climate change to protect coral ecosystems.The coral bleaching threshold is 29.5°C because prolonged exposure to sea temperatures above this level causes stress in corals, leading to the expulsion of symbiotic algae, ultimately resulting in coral bleaching.</p>

          <div><h1>Bleaching Events</h1>
            <p style="text-align: justify;margin-right: 20px;">The graph illustrates a troubling increase in coral bleaching events globally over the past decades. Coral bleaching, which occurs when corals experience prolonged exposure to stressors such as elevated sea temperatures, has been happening more frequently, especially since the late 1990s. In the past, such events were relatively rare, with fewer bleaching episodes reported in the 1980s. However, as ocean temperatures continue to rise, driven by global climate change, the number of bleaching events has surged, with severe bleaching (where more than 30% of the coral is affected) becoming more common in recent years. The years 1998, 2010, and 2016 show particularly stark peaks in bleaching events, indicating the growing vulnerability of coral reefs worldwide. This trend underscores the urgent need for global climate action to reduce warming and protect these delicate ecosystems from further destruction.</p>
